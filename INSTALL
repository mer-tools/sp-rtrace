sp-rtrace installation instructions
====================================

1. Compiling from sources
-------------------------

1.1 Dependencies
----------------

The following packages must be installed before compiling sp-rtrace
on Debian based systems:
  autoconf(>=2.67), automake(>=1.11), libtool(>=2.2.6), doxygen(>=1.7.1),
  binutils-dev(>=2.20.1), libglib2.0-dev(>=2.24.2)

Note that earlier versions might also work.

In RPM based distributions the dependencies are named a bit differently,
and you need:
   autoconf, automake, libtool, doxygen, binutils-devel, glib2-devel,
   gcc-c++, zlib-devel


1.2 Compilation & Installation
------------------------------

To compile sp-rtrace extract the source archive and do the following
steps in the sp-rtrace directory:

  1) Greate configuration file with "autoreconf -fi"
  2) Create makefile with "./configure"
     The configure tool accepts standard parameters (like installation 
     directory etc.). Try "./configure --help to see all options. There
     are two sp-rtrace specific optional parameters:
     --enable-debug-info  - enables additional debug output in console.
     --disable-precomp    - disables precompiled header usage for C++
                            parts.
  3) Build the sp-rtrace binaries with "make"
  4) Install the bult binaries with "make install"
  5) Run "ldconfig -v" so that dynamic linker finds libsp-rtrace.so


1.3 Trace data visualization dependencies
-----------------------------------------

Timeline charts and callgraphs require additional packages to be
installed.  Timeline generation requires Gnuplot (gnuplot-nox in
Debian) and callgraph generation requires GraphViz (graphviz package
in Debian).


1.4 Troubleshooting
-------------------

While precompiled headers speeds up C++ compilation, often it makes
hard to locate the error sources. If this is a problem disable precompiled
headers with --disable-precomp configure option (see Compilation &
Installation).

sp-rtrace will at run-time print additional debug messages when
configured with --enable-debug-info option (see Compilation &
Installation).

If sp-rtrace utilities don't find the modules or other utilities, you
can use "strace -f" to trace where they try to find them.

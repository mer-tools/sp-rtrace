#
# CHANGES
#
# 2010-08-02
# - Updated this sp-libleaks utility to support rtrace format and
#   moved it to sp-rtrace package
# 2010-09-10
# - Update help and calltree options
# - If destination file is older than source file, re-create it
# - If files are already generated, don't check for / complain
#  about tools needed to generate them
# 2010-11-03
# - Rewrite to handle both binary & text traces and whether they're
#   already processed or not.
# 2010-11-10
# - Use SVG instead of EPS, open generated file with xdg-open,
#   better corner-case error checks

$name generates SVG callgraph(s) of resource allocation
backtraces going through the methods/functions/libraries with given
name prefix, in all the given trace files.  The graphs are saved
to a subdirectory with a same name prefix.

Good values for the <limit> percentage are 0.1 - 5, depending on
the trace file contents.

To re-generate the graphs (with new limit), just remove the directory.

sp-rtrace testsuite
===================

By default the testsuite is compiled and executed with make check.
To allow easier testing on embeded devices it's possible to separate
compile and test process with the following environment variables:
  RT_DISABLE_COMPILE - set to 1 to disable compilation 
  RT_DISABLE_TEST - set to 1 to disable test execution.
  
The test suite requires dejagnu package.

sp-rtrace.postproc/generate_samples.sh script regenerates sample
logs used in post-procesor testing. To generate them:
1) run make check with testing disabled,
2) run the generate_samples.sh script from sp-rtrace.postproc dir.


Running tests on a device:
==========================
1) Compile the package: dpkg-buildpackge -rfakeroot -b 
2) Compile test applications by executing RT_DISABLE_TEST=1 make check
   in tests directory
3) Copy the test directory to device.
4) If device has small (non-standard) max pty limit, increase it:
   echo 32 > /proc/sys/kernel/pty/max
5) Run testsuite by executing RT_DISABLE_COMPILE=1 runtest --tool=sp-rtrace

Directory structure:
====================
lib - common files used by test cases

sp-rtrace.core - test cases for internal data containers. Contains tests
  of dlist_t, htable_t, sarray_t data structures and related API.
  
sp-rtrace.lib - test cases for libsp-rtrace1 shared library. Contains 
  tests of context and formatter API

sp-rtrace.modules - test cases for tracing modules. Contains tracked 
  function coverage tests for memory and memtransfer modules.
  
sp-rtrace.postproc - test cases for post-processing options. Contains 
  tests of various post-processing options applied to a provided trace file.
  
sp-rtrace.resolve - test cases for symbol resolving. Contains basic
  tests of resolving backtraces of applications compiled with and 
  without debug symbols and C++ name demangling.
  
sp-rtrace.rtrace - test cases for process launching and trace toggling. 
  Contains tests of starting/toggling target processes with trace
  enabled/disabled at start with/without post-processing options in 
  managed/normal mode.

  Before running this test, please make sure there aren't trace_test
  processes left running from a previous (interrupted or failed)
  run as test expects there to be only single such process.

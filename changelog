sp-rtrace (1.8.1), 23 Aug 2011:
  * Add --quiet option suppressing warning messages to sp-rtrace,
    sp-rtrace-postproc, sp-rtrace-resolve.
  * Add symbolic signal name support for -S option.

sp-rtrace (1.8), 3 Aug 2011:
  * The option `-p' has been changed to `-e' to match functracer option names.
  * Audit module has been removed (`-a' option). sp-rtrace cannot track (even
    exported) function calls well enough due to limitations of the linker
    LD_AUDIT mechanism. Functracer can be used for the same purpose.

sp-rtrace (1.7), 30 Jun 2011:
  * Swap size and type fields in binary protocol to fix crashes.

sp-rtrace (1.6.1), 16 Jun 2011:
  * Fix bfd symbol resolving issues: If sp-rtrace backtraces go through
    certain kind of method/function calls where the call argument is a
    temporary object that gets constructed & destructed during argument
    handling, sp-rtrace-resolve resolves to destructor of that temporary
    object instead of the function/method call on which line it was used.
  * Calculate toggle signal during options parsing: the toggle signal was
    calculated only when sp-trace was used in toggle mode. This caused
    interrupting sp-rtrace with ctrl+c to send the default toggle signal even
    if custom signal was specified.
  * Write pagemap files into start directory if not specified otherwise.

sp-rtrace (1.6), 1 Jun 2011:
  * Improve SIGINT handling: tracing can now be stopped simply by aborting
    sp-rtrace with ctrl+c. If the tracing was enabled from the start (-s
    option), then the target process will be stopped after the data has been
    transferred and pipe closed. Otherwise sp-rtrace collects the data, but
    does not stop the target process.
  * New sp-rtrace option --monitor: Report backtraces only for allocations
    having the specified resource size(s).

sp-rtrace (1.5.2), 24 May 2011:
  * sp-rtrace-timeline --filter-time now allows relative time values.
  * Fix incorrect close() in trace toggling path.

sp-rtrace (1.5.1), 9 May 2011:
  * Do not send toggle signal to a process that is not traced.

sp-rtrace (1.5), 28 Apr 2011:
  * Pagemap post-processing utility for memory fragmentation analysis
  * New --include/--exclude options to sp-rtrace-postproc (for pagemap)
  * Improvements to rtrace-calltree:
    - new "allocation count" callgraph type
    - new options for reducing node (text) sizes, enabled by default
  * sp-rtrace-timeline charts X-axis shows both alloc count & time
  * Speedup for memory allocation tracking for programs doing
    simultenous allocations from many threads

sp-rtrace (1.4.1), 4 Mar 2011:
  * Fix BFD resolving segfault (data freed too early)
  * Fix sp-rtrace-postproc crash with traces containing multiple
    resource types
  * Fix/update rtrace-calltree --trace-args option and rename it
    to --show-args.  Add --include-only-args option to do the same
    thing for callgraph arg nodes as --include-only does for
    function nodes
  * Fix shmposix trace function names (mmap2 & mmap64 instead of mmap)
  * Test suite has now tests for all modules

sp-rtrace (1.4), 16 Feb 2011:
  * Debug package, compiler option, x86 reliability and memory leak fixes
  * "origin" field added to text format header. 
  * HTML and histogram reports removed from rtrace-calltree. Former isn't
    really useful and latter functionality is now in sp-rtrace-timeline
  * Major rtrace-calltree speed improvement for large traces
  * Post-processing tools updated to accept audit traces where
    traced functions have C++ signatures
  * sp-rtrace-timeline --scalex option value is now in percentages
    and resource life-time timeline Y-axis is logarithmic
  * New module and post-processing tools to track which of the process.
    memory pages are dirty and whether they're zeroed.  Added trace file
    format support for references to additional data files
  * New module for tracing POSIX shared memory mappings
  * SYSV shared memory module reports "shmctl(...,IPC_RMID,...)" events
  * Documentation updates and MeeGo compatibility fixes

sp-rtrace (1.3), 10 Dec 2010:
  * C++ rewrite of rtrace-timeline to make it faster
  * Improved support for resource reference counting
  * Binary and ASCII trace file format changes for above
  * Added module generator script, module code template & examples
  * New modules for tracing QObject and Gobject create/reference/free
  * Renamed shmseg module to shmsysv (as it's in functracer)
  * Experimental user specified function tracing support and module
    based on dynamic linker LD_AUDIT framework
  * Put allocmap temp files to current dir, use faster options
    and better error handling in rtrace-allocmap
  * Support new Linux pipe2() function in sp-rtrace file module

sp-rtrace (1.2), 11 Nov 2010:
  * rtrace-timeline script rewrite:
    - total non-freed allocations timeline chart
    - allocation activity timeline chart
    - allocation life-time timeline chart
    - allocation count & size per alloc size histograms
    - possible to generate all charts at the same time
    - huge memory usage reduction
    - options for filtering allocations & deallocations based on
      allocation record, timestamp or size range and scaling chart
  * rtrace-graphs-overview script rewrite:
    - resource file includes information about filtering done on it
    - handle both binary and ascii files
    - input files need now to be specified
    - generate also (all) timeline charts
    - show the generated charts with xdg-open
  * rtrace-callgree updates:
    - ignore deallocation backtraces
    - option to filter allocations based on size range
    - updates to glib/qt function/method ignore shortcuts
  * Experimental support for using libunwind to collect backtraces
  * Binary and ASCII trace file format changes for above
  * Context API library changes needed by functracer
  * Post-processing speed and memory usage improvements
  * Force i486 architecture for x86 (Sbox). 
    (GCC version specific atomic ops issue)
  * Automake&libtool added to build-deps. 

sp-rtrace (1.1), 23 Sep 2010:
  * Function name resolving verifies libbfd provide information from
    the ELF symbol table to get rid of bogus information provided
    by BFD for inline/template methods.  This may also remove useful
    information, for that case one can ask resolving to use just BFD.
  * Fixes to tracing toggling and backtrace generation
  * Modules can trace activity done before process enters main()
  * New file module for tracing file descriptor increase & decrease
  * Backtraces for freed resources are optional (improves performance)
  * Backtrace is output in similar format to one used by Gdb
  * rtrace-calltree:
    - HTML report generation & pylint errors fixed
    - callgraphs handle resource freeing backtraces properly
    - more & updated --ignore-* convenience functions
    - option for seeing first function arguments (e.g. filename) as nodes
  * Preliminary unfreed allocs & allocation activity timeline charts

sp-rtrace (1.0), 29 Jun 2010:
  * Initial Release.

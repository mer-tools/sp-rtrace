sp-rtrace (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debug package, compiler option, x86 reliability and memory leak fixes
    Fixes: NB#216303
  * "origin" field added to text format header. Fixes NB#215920
  * HTML and histogram reports removed from rtrace-calltree. Former isn't
    really useful and latter functionality is now in sp-rtrace-timeline
  * Major rtrace-calltree speed improvement for large traces
  * Post-processing tools updated to accept audit traces where
    traced functions have C++ signatures
  * sp-rtrace-timeline --scalex option value is now in percentages
    and resource life-time timeline Y-axis is logarithmic
  * New module and post-processing tools to track which of the process.
    memory pages are dirty and whether they're zeroed.  Added trace file
    format support for references to additional data files
  * New module for tracing POSIX shared memory mappings
  * SYSV shared memory module reports "shmctl(...,IPC_RMID,...)" events
  * Documentation updates and MeeGo compatibility fixes

sp-rtrace (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * C++ rewrite of rtrace-timeline to make it faster
  * Improved support for resource reference counting
  * Binary and ASCII trace file format changes for above
  * Added module generator script, module code template & examples
  * New modules for tracing QObject and Gobject create/reference/free
  * Renamed shmseg module to shmsysv (as it's in functracer)
  * Experimental user specified function tracing support and module
    based on dynamic linker LD_AUDIT framework
    Fixes: NB#164143
  * Put allocmap temp files to current dir, use faster options
    and better error handling in rtrace-allocmap
    Fixes: NB#207896
  * Support new Linux pipe2() function in sp-rtrace file module
    Fixes: NB#210523

sp-rtrace (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * rtrace-timeline script rewrite:
    - total non-freed allocations timeline chart
    - allocation activity timeline chart
    - allocation life-time timeline chart
    - allocation count & size per alloc size histograms
    - possible to generate all charts at the same time
    - huge memory usage reduction
    - options for filtering allocations & deallocations based on
      allocation record, timestamp or size range and scaling chart
    Fixes: NB#153186
  * rtrace-graphs-overview script rewrite:
    - resource file includes information about filtering done on it
    - handle both binary and ascii files
    - input files need now to be specified
    - generate also (all) timeline charts
    - show the generated charts with xdg-open
  * rtrace-callgree updates:
    - ignore deallocation backtraces
    - option to filter allocations based on size range
    - updates to glib/qt function/method ignore shortcuts
  * Experimental support for using libunwind to collect backtraces
  * Binary and ASCII trace file format changes for above
  * Context API library changes needed by functracer
  * Post-processing speed and memory usage improvements
  * Force i486 architecture for x86 (Sbox). Fixes: NB#201366
    (GCC version specific atomic ops issue)
  * Automake&libtool added to build-deps. Fixes: NB#194298

sp-rtrace (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Function name resolving verifies libbfd provide information from
    the ELF symbol table to get rid of bogus information provided
    by BFD for inline/template methods.  This may also remove useful
    information, for that case one can ask resolving to use just BFD.
    Fixes: NB#192289
  * Fixes to tracing toggling and backtrace generation
  * Modules can trace activity done before process enters main()
  * New file module for tracing file descriptor increase & decrease
  * Backtraces for freed resources are optional (improves performance)
  * Backtrace is output in similar format to one used by Gdb
  * rtrace-calltree:
    - HTML report generation & pylint errors fixed
    - callgraphs handle resource freeing backtraces properly
    - more & updated --ignore-* convenience functions
    - option for seeing first function arguments (e.g. filename) as nodes
  * Preliminary unfreed allocs & allocation activity timeline charts
